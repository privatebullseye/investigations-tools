📍 Bullseye Investigations – GPS & Tracking Demo Tools

Welcome to the Bullseye Investigations GPS & Tracking Demo Repository.
These tools are designed to demonstrate how device-based location technology works — including its strengths, limitations, and privacy considerations.

⚠️ Important: These tools are for educational and testing purposes only. They must not be used for covert surveillance or tracking individuals without their full consent.

🔍 What This Project Demonstrates

How GPS and browser-based geolocation detect a device’s position

The active user permissions required before location access is granted

The accuracy limitations of location services

How different devices, browsers, and signals can return incomplete or inconsistent coordinates

This helps users understand why DIY tracking technologies can often:

Jump to the wrong location

Display delayed data

Miss movement entirely

Require network/battery conditions that aren’t always met

These inaccuracies can create misleading assumptions if relied on for personal or investigative conclusions.

🛠 Included Tools
Tool	Purpose	Notes
GPS Location Demo	Shows current detected coordinates & accuracy values	Requires user permission
Mapping Integration Example	Plots coordinates visually on a basic map interface	Not designed for real-time tracking
Code Samples	Simple geolocation JavaScript functions	For learning only, not deployment

All components are lightweight and run purely in the browser — no tracking data is stored, logged, or transmitted.

🧑‍⚖️ Legal & Ethical Notice

Under the Surveillance Devices Act 1998 (WA) and similar legislation across Australia:

Installing, using, or maintaining a tracking device to determine someone’s location without consent is a criminal offence.

These tools are intended to promote safe, transparent, and lawful use of tracking technology.

If you require legitimate surveillance for an investigation, always consult a licensed private investigator.
